It takes input POStagged & NPChunked sentences. Download the input file (1.1 million sentences of ClueWeb12 corpus) from "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0BIDBPb5ptqSUNUWFpOVjJpZ3M/view?usp=sharing";

It collect all words that precede relational nouns and are in the same NP chunk, are of appropriate POS (JJ, NN, NNP, etc), are not a known demonym and donâ€™t end in a possessive.
